### How to Visualize Sequence Diagrams in PlantUML

The `sequence_diagram.md` document contains `.plantuml` code blocks that describe sequence diagrams for the application.

To visualize this these diagrams with online PlantUML:

1. **Copy the Diagram Code:** Select the full `@startuml … @enduml` block.
2. **Open a PlantUML Renderer:** Use [online PlantUML renderer](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/).
3. **Paste the Code:** Paste the copied block into the editor’s input area.
4. **View / Export the Diagram:** The diagram will be generated automatically. Download it as PNG/SVG.

For more information on PlantUML refer to the official documentation: [https://plantuml.com/](https://plantuml.com/).
