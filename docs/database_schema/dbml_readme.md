### How to Visualize Database Schema in DBML

This `database_erd_dbml.md` contains document a `.dsl` code block which uses Database Markup Language (DBML) to describe the structure of the application database schema.

To visualize this schema as an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):

1.  **Copy the Code:** Select the full script block.
2.  **Go to dbdiagram.io:** Navigate to [https://dbdiagram.io/home](https://dbdiagram.io/home).
3.  **Paste the Code:** In the editor panel on the left side of the `dbdiagram.io`, delete any existing sample code and paste the DBML script.
4.  **View / Export the Diagram:** The database diagram should be automatically generated and to appear in the right panel.

You can use this tool to **view relationships** between tables, understand **data types**, and grasp the overall **database structure**.

For more information on the DBML syntax refer to the official documentation: [https://dbml.dbdiagram.io/docs/](https://dbml.dbdiagram.io/docs/)
